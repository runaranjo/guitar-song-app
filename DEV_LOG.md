1. Ok so first created a projects folder and create this app folder GUITAR-SONG-APP 
2. For now i think only table needed is SONGS table and database called songify
3. will initialize repository and then create repo in github - Done
4. npm init -y to initinalize node
5. npm i express (routes etc), pg (database), ejs (frontend)
6. install nodemon for testing in dev "npm i --save-dev nodemon" (refreshes server automatically)
7. Created folder public, views and db
8. Started importing pg into db.js within db folder
9. Created README.md and this renamed to DEV_LOG.md
10. Can add "type": module to package.json to use import in files
11. middleware usarlo en app.js, index.js para iniciar app - export default app
12. ok en EJS - en index incluir todo lo que vaya en body. y en header y footer.ejs <body> y </body> respectivamente.
13. REMEMBER: POST IS TO SEND DATA - use a href to make a button take you to other page
