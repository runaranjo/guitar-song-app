Ok this file will work as a draft and container of thoughts for my project
I will be laying out what im doing and why im doing it to have somewhere to look back to.

1. Ok so first created a projects folder and create this app folder GUITAR-SONG-APP 
2. For now i think only table needed is SONGS table and database called songify
3. will initialize repository and then create repo in github
